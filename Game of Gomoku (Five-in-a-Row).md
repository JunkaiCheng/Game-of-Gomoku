# Game of Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row 五子棋)
This game plays with stones of two colors (red and blue in these figures), on a board with 49 empty spaces arranged in a 7x7 grid. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection (in these instructions, the player who goes first uses the red stones, and the player who goes second uses the blue stones). The winner is the player who first forms an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is a tie if all intersections are filled up with stones but neither side wins the game.

We will use reflex agent, Minimax and Alpha-beta Agents to play Gomokul and we also have a GUI.

This project is completed by Zikun Chen and Junkai Cheng.
